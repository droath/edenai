# EdenAI Sandbox Testing Environment Configuration
#
# This file provides a template for setting up environment variables
# required for running functional tests against the EdenAI API.
#
# IMPORTANT: These tests make REAL API calls to EdenAI's production endpoint
# and will consume API credits. Only use for sandbox/functional testing.
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.testing in the project root
# 2. Replace the placeholder value with your actual EdenAI API key
# 3. Obtain your API key from: https://app.edenai.run/admin/account/settings
#
# Security Notice:
# - .env.testing is git-ignored to prevent accidentally committing credentials
# - Never commit your actual API key to version control
# - Keep your API key confidential and rotate it if exposed
#
# Running Sandbox Tests:
# Execute: vendor/bin/pest --group=sandbox-test
#
# Note: Sandbox tests are excluded from CI/CD pipelines to control API costs
# and rate limits. They must be run manually with valid credentials.

# EdenAI API Key (required for sandbox tests)
# Get your key from: https://app.edenai.run/admin/account/settings
EDENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
